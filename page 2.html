            In Celtic mythology, the Unicorn was a symbol of purity and innocence, as well as masculinity and power.<br>
            Tales of dominance and chivalry associated with the unicorn may be why it was chosen as Scotland's national animal, and yes, it really is the national animal of Scotland.
